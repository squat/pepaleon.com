> The paintings of Pepa Leon are first of all, organic abstractions and a testimony to the fertile imagination of the human mind. They are the result of two distinct approaches: gestural brushwork and screen-printing. Pepa is a physical painter. She works out on the canvas, attentive to what is happening right in front her. She paints with boxer's moves, jabbing at the surface, swiping skeins of strong color across the canvas. Grabbing a prepared screen, she then squeegees some floral patterns or polka dots over the paint. Next, Pepa quickly moves on to paint over parts of the screened elements. The painting comes alive as this give and take develops like an organism being born. Her best paintings never settle down, are never polite. The viewer is pulled into a vibrant world of cause and effect. Words cannot describe it.
